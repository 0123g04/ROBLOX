	['HttpWait'] = 30; --How often (in seconds) should the list(s) update? Recommended 10+ to avoid HttpService problems
		--[[
		NOTE: The board configured by default is our large constantly updated exploiter ban list. 
		If you wish to keep 900+ known exploiters out of your game the defaults are the way to go.
			
		You NEED to enable HttpEnabled in order for this to work! To enable it follow the below instructions:
		Run this following command in the command bar as shown in the screenshot: game:service('HttpService').HttpEnabled=true print('Enabled Http')
		Screen shot: http://prntscr.com/46uztz
		
		How to set up your own multi-game list for your games:
		
		Below instructions are for bans but can also be applied to admin lists,
		refer to "To use this for synced admin lists" under the instructions for admin lists info. 
		
		By default the Trello settings are set to use our ban list of exploiters, but you may 
		want to change it so that you can set up and control your own multi-game, autoupdating 
		list(s). So now I am going to tell you how to do that.
		
		1. Enable Http, refer to a few lines up to learn how to easily and quickly do that.
		2. Make a Trello account (or sign in with google)
			-Go to http://trello.com, click "Log in with Google" or "Sign up-It's Free" and do the account making stuff it tells you to
		3. After you sign up/log in you need to make a new board, click the + then click "New Board..." - http://prntscr.com/46v2fq
		4. Give your board a name and click the "Change..." next to "This board will be private" and make sure you make the board public! - http://prntscr.com/46v4bf
		5. Change one of the lists titles to "Ban List" In the screenshot I accidentally typed "cards" instead of "lists" - http://prntscr.com/46v5af
		6. Add people to the bans by clicking "Add a card..." and then typing their username as the title, username:userid, or if its a group Group: groupname:groupid - http://prntscr.com/46v74e
		7. Now you need to just set BoardID to your board's ID, refer to http://prntscr.com/46v74e for this, or refer to the comment next to the BoardID setting
		8. You are done, just configure the BoardID and enable Http in each of your games and your multigame banlist is done, confure your board however you want as long as you leave the "Ban List" list that contains name and keep the board public so the script can read it!
		Use our site for reference: https://trello.com/b/9HH6BEX2/epix-incorporated-synced-ban-list
		
		To use this for synced admin lists, simply repeat the above steps replacing Ban List with
		Admin List, Mod List, or Owner List, anyone added to these list will appear in
		the admin list with [Synced] next to their name, they will not be able to be unadmined.
		Admin lists do not yet support Group: NAME:ID however they do support Username:ID format.
		You can also add songs, mutes, and edit commands permissions via Trello!
		To add songs via Trello make a new list named "Music List" then just add songs in the format
		NAME:ID to have them show up in the music list. Adding mutes works the exact same way as bans, just name
		the list "Mute List" instead. To edit commands permissions make a new list named "Permissions" then simply
		add commands in the following format (WITH THEIR PREFIX!) COMMAND:LEVEL

		Settings can be found in the Settings ModuleScript parented with this!

		For AutoUpdate to work this script's model needs to be in your inventory,
		if you got the script from anywhere other than my models the AutoUpdate
		will not work due to ROBLOX security nonsense. You can find the model
		here: http://www.roblox.com/item.aspx?id=145629584	
		It is important to stay up to date!
		
		To manually update, simply insert the new Loader script from your inventory,
		drag the "Settings" ModuleScript to it, and then remove the old version.
		
		Previously known as Kohl's Admin [Epix Edition]
		
		For information about LoadStringEnabled please refer to the following:
		
		http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Security#LoadStringEnabled
		http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Points_tutorial#Restrictions
		
		If you want to use the :s command you will need to set LoadStringEnabled
		to true. It can be found by going into studio, opening the explorer and properties
		windows, clicking on ServerScriptService and under properties checking
		LoadStringEnabled. Loadstring is only used in the script for Output and
		the scripting command. The script will function fine without it. Currently
		:ls and :cs are unusable due to updates that removed loadstring() abilities
		from the client, meaning no more local script building in-game.
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		IF THERE ARE NEW SETTINGS YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY UPDATE THE SCRIPT TO
		CHANGE THEM, THEY WILL OTHERWISE BE LEFT AS THE DEFAULT. (Unless you use :settings)
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Please carefully read each setting's description BEFORE changing something
		as you could break something if you set something the wrong way.

		Find A security flaw or bug? 
		Know of a way to detect an exploit or make the AntiExploit better?
		Think of a way to make the script better? 
		Send me a message!

	-- Tips and Tricks --
	---------------------
		
			:kill me,noob1,noob2,!random,%raiders,$123456,!nonadmins,#3,radius-5,friends,-sceleratis
			-- kills you, noob1, noob2, a random person, team raiders, people in group 123456, nonadmins, 3 random people, anyone within a 5 stud radius of you, friends, and exclude the user Sceleratis.
			You can also run silent commands using /e, for example:
			"/e :kill scel"
			*Note, by silent I just mean people won't see you chat it, it however will still show up in logs. Its better to just use the console.
			
		You can also use a variety commands for different people;
			 all -- Everyone in the server
			 others -- Everyone but you
			 me -- You
			 admins -- Admins in the server
			 nonadmins -- People who are not admins in the server
			 random -- A random person, this can include you.
			 friends -- Anyone on your friends list
			 besties -- Anyone on your best friends list
			 %TEAMNAME -- Ex: :kill %raiders will kill everyone in team Raiders.
			 $GROUPID -- Let you run a command anyone in a specific group, if an ID is not given it will use the GroupId setting.
			 -PLAYERNAME -- Lets you exclude players from commands. :kill !all,-scel will kill everyone but scel
			 #NUMBER -- Lets you run a command on NUMBER of random people. :ff #5 will ff 5 random players.
			 radius-NUMBER -- Lets you run a command on anyone within a NUMBER stud radius of you. :ff radius-5 will ff any player(s) within a 5 stud radius of you.
			
		If you want to add cameras to your game (like saved into your game so you don't need to use the admin script to spawn them every new server)
		then just make a camera, needs to be a single part, so a sphere, brick, what ever it may be, make sure its anchored and locked
		just simply position it where you want in workspace, then make its name Camera: NAMEHERE
		so for example: Camera: Cam1
		the name is very important as the script will look for it in workspace when the game starts.
		make sure you name each camera something diffierent. You can preset waypoints the same way, just use Waypoint: instead of Camera:
		
		MESSAGES/HINTS FOR OTHER SCRIPTS:
		If you would like to have the hints/messages from this script usable in other SERVER (not local)
		scripts, then simply put the follow at the top of your script,
		
		message=_G['Message']
		hint=_G['Hint']
		
		USAGE EXAMPLES: 
		hint(msg,playerstable) - message(title,msg,playerstable)
		
		(Do note that playerstable needs to be a table containing players NOT player names! 
		Use game:service('Players'):children() to send a message to everyone.)
		
		hint('Hello people',game:service('Players'):children())  <=== sends "Hello people" to all players in game
		hint('Heyo scel',{game:service('Players').Sceleratis}) <=== Sends "Heyo scel" to the player Sceleratis
		message('Server Message','Hello people',game:service('Players'):children())  <=== Makes a message with the title "Server Message" and a message of "Hello people"
		message('Message from swagyguy','Heyo celary man',{game:service('Players').Sceleratis}) <=== Works the same as above but only the player Sceleratis sees it
